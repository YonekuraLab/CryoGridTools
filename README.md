# CryoGridTools  
3D printing data in "Tidy up cryo-EM sample grids with 3D printed tools"  
  
## Description  
STL files can be imported directly to 3D printing.  
BLENDER files are original design files for modification by Blender, free software (https://www.blender.org/).
    
## Recommendation  
FDM 3D printer with ABS filaments is suitable for printing of these tools.  
Slower head speed, slower cooling rate, and stable emvironment are required for quality printing.

### GridCaseStacker
Storage for disk-shaped grid cases in liquid nitrogen. The grid case stacker holds three grid cases. The five stackers can be kept inside a wide-use centrifuge tube. The steel flat-head metal screw with a diameter of ~ 3.2 mm and a length of ~ 12 mm on the stacker is fitted with a CrystalWand Magnetic.

### GridCaseOrientator
This grid case orientator is fitted inside the outer space around the ethane vessel of the ethane container.  The user can drop a grid case with plunge-frozen grids onto the orientator in liquid nitrogen, and the orientator supports the grid case in an upright position.  

### GridCaseHolder
3D printed holder that lacks one arm, thereby affording enough room for the orientator.

### MagneticWand1,2
A simple pickup wand and then glued a small neodymium magnet (~ 6 mmÏ†) onto the tip. The stacker is easily released under liquid nitrogen by a wrenching action of the wand. MagneticWand 1 and 2 are connected by glue.

### Spacers
Spacers are placed on top of the stacker for transport. Spacer 1 is for five stackers in 50 mL tube. Spacer 2 ~ 5 are for four to one stackers.

### GridCase base and top
Two- four- and six-hole grid cases.

### RetainerStocker
A retainer stocker of JEOL microscope. This retainer stocker accommodates four retainers, and is usually kept inside a desiccator till use.
